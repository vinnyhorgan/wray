# Modules

Wray is meant to be a simple and minimal wren runtime.
It only provides a thin layer over native functionality.
This means many things need to be implemented from scratch, which is part of the fun!
Some things though can be packaged as wren modules to be reused!
This folder contains some of those modules, feel free to contribute any of your own!

- [vector](vector.wren): simple 2d vector class.
- [json](json.wren): json parser. Thanks [brandly](https://github.com/brandly/wren-json)!
